# Python - Variable Annotations
This project explores the use of variable annotations and type hints in Python 3. The goal is to write type-annotated functions and variables that improve code clarity, facilitate static analysis, and enhance the development workflow. All code is written in compliance with PEP8 style guidelines and includes proper documentation.

# Project Requirements
All files must start with #!/usr/bin/env python3.

Files should be interpreted with Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Only the following editors are allowed: vi, vim, emacs.

Each Python file must be executable and end with a new line.

Every file must comply with pycodestyle (PEP8).

A real documentation string (docstring) is required for every module, class, and function.

The README file must be placed at the root of this directory: python_variable_annotations.

# Key Concepts
Use of type hints for function parameters, return values, and variables.

Benefits of variable annotation for code readability and static type checking.

Compatibility with tools such as mypy or Pyright for type validation.
