# Python - Pagination

## Introduction

Pagination in Python involves dividing large datasets (such as lists, database query results, or CSV files) into smaller, manageable chunks called "pages." This is essential for improving performance, reducing memory usage, and enhancing user experience in applications like web APIs, data processing scripts, or web scrapers. Without pagination, fetching thousands of items at once can lead to slow responses and resource exhaustion.

This README focuses on basic offset-based pagination using list slicing, which is common in educational projects and simple APIs. It aligns with common practices seen in Python tutorials and libraries.​
